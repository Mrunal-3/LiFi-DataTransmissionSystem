Implementation Video- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rufyWFUdQ12QpcCuooksLIYXafIflyF4?usp=sharing


A key element of display-based optical camera communication is pattern recognition. Each pattern demands significant processing resources to decode. A growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) areas are interested in using optical camera communication (OCC) to offer non-radio frequency-based communication solutions. This OCC system is based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) concepts and can provide user-centric multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) capabilities. In order to obtain longer communication distance and effective pattern classification, Quantum Chromodynamics Inspired 2D Multicolor LED Matrix to Camera Communication. Using nested outer and inner patterns, custom patterns are created at the transmitter based on input data. For quicker decoding on the receiver side, inner and outer patterns are subjected to multi-threaded pattern matching simultaneously. The steps involved are encoding the bit pattern and decoding the same. 
Decentralised operation of LiFi networks allows individual devices using LiFi technology to speak with one another directly without the use of a central hub or controller. With LiFi technology, every device in this configuration may transmit and receive data. Without a central coordinating unit, this decentralised architecture allows for flexibility and autonomous device communication.
